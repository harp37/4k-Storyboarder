**Introducing 4k Storyboarder, Your New Favorite 4K Vector Animation App**
_A hand-drawn style vector animation tool for creating high-quality 4K animations with an intuitive interface. Draw frame-by-frame animations with vector paths and export them as SVG files.
_

Features
4K Canvas Resolution - Create animations at 3840Ã—2160 pixels for professional-quality vector graphics
Vector-Based Drawing - All artwork is created with scalable vector paths, allowing for clean scaling and export
Frame-by-Frame Animation - Traditional animation workflow with customizable frame timing
Multiple Drawing Tools - Pencil for creation, eraser for modifications, and selection tool for manipulating paths
Color Libraries - Pre-set color palettes (neon and calming colors) for quick access to harmonious color schemes
Onion Skinning - See the previous frame while drawing for smoother animations
Frame Controls - Copy and paste frames, set repeat counts for each frame
Customizable FPS - Adjust playback speed from 1 to 24 frames per second
SVG Export - Save individual frames or all animation frames as SVG files

Getting Started

The interface is divided into three main sections:
Left Panel - Drawing tools and color palettes
Center Area - 4K drawing canvas where you'll create your animation
Bottom Panel - Timeline with frame management controls


To begin animating:
Use the pencil tool to draw on the canvas
Add new frames with the "Add Frame" button in the timeline
Use onion skinning to reference previous frames while drawing
Preview your animation using the Play button

Drawing Tools
Pencil Tool - Create smooth vector paths with customizable thickness and color
Eraser Tool - Remove or modify existing paths
Selection Tool - Select and modify existing lines:

Click on a line to select it
Move the line by dragging
Rotate the line using the rotation handle (pink circle)

Stroke Width - Adjust line thickness from 1 to 100 pixels
Color Picker - Choose any color with the color input or select from predefined palettes


Animation Controls

Timeline Navigation - Click on any frame thumbnail to select and edit it
Frame Management:

Add Frame - Create a new blank frame
Delete Frame - Remove the current frame (cannot delete if only one frame exists)
Clear Frame - Erase all content from the current frame

Onion Skinning - Toggle to see the previous frame as a transparent overlay
Frame Repeat - Set how many times each frame should repeat during playback:

Hover over a frame to see the repeat count editor
Values range from 1 to 24 repeats


Playback Controls:

Play - Start animation playback from the current frame
Stop - Halt the animation
FPS Slider - Adjust the frames per second (1-24)


Saving and Exporting

Save Frame - Export the current frame as an SVG file
Save All - Export all frames as a ZIP archive containing individual SVG files
Load SVG - Import an SVG file into the current frame


Tips and Tricks

Use onion skinning for smoother animations by maintaining consistency between frames
For complex animations, create key frames first and then add in-between frames
Adjust stroke width based on the level of detail you need
Use the selection tool to reposition elements between frames for more controlled movement
Copy and paste frames to create repeated sequences
Set different repeat counts for frames to create varied timing effects without adding new frames
Lower FPS creates a more stop-motion look, while higher FPS creates smoother animations


Enjoy creating beautiful vector animations! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
